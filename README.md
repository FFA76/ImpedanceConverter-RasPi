# Instructions for building an Impedance converter for the Raspberry Pi

## Summary 

This project provides instructions for building an impedance converter for the Raspberry Pi (a single-board computer), as used in physics labs for students at the Faculty of Physics at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.

The framework for this was based on the [PhyPiDAQ](https://github.com/PhyPiDAQ) project, which aims to provide students access to state-of-the-art measurement technology and data
acquisition tools.
